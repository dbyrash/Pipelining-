# Pipelining Implementation

5 stage Pipeline model implementation on how the data is processed through using RISCV-ISA. A detailed implementation on how data is fetched, decoded, executed, and writeback including all the Structural and Control hazards. Implementation of stages takes place and there is a bit change in the SCOREBOARD with Branch/Jump statements. The concept of SCOREBOARD is based on TUMASULO.
